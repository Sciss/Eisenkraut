(diamond shaped icon from the toolbar). blending will apply crossfades to editing operations, for example to avoid clicks when cutting.</P><P>to save your file, press <tt>meta</tt>+<tt>s</tt>. to save under a new name, choose save-as from the file menu. a rather strange dialog will pop up showing the current path name and format. to browse the harddisk, click on the small list symbol right to the path name.</P><h3>sound playback</h3><P>to actually hear your sound when running the transport, supercollider server needs to be running. you will want to set the preferences to automatically boot supercollider when eisenkraut is launched (<A HREF="prefsAudio.html">audio preferences</A>). for the first time, start supercollider manually: go to the <A HREF="MainFrame.html">main window</A>. press boot and wait, until the button's text changes to &quot;terminate&quot;. if you encounter an error, check the following things:</P><UL><LI>open eisenkraut's preferences, go to the audio tab. check that scsynth application really points to supercollider server (the file <code>scsynth<var>[</var>.exe<var>]</var></code> in your supercollider folder!).</LI><LI>if you get an error message saying that option <code>-H</code> is not understood, make sure the &quot;Default&quot; audio card is selected. If on the contrary on the Mac an error appears with two different sound cards for input and output (e.g. &quot;Built-in Microphone&quot; and &quot;Built-in Output&quot;), you will need to create an aggregate sound device in your system's audio-midi-setup and add that to the audio interfaces list.</LI><LI>note on mac, that the built in audio card doesn't support sample rates other than 44.1 kHz. set the hardware sample rate prefernces to 0 (zero) to use the valid default sample rate. it has been experienced that some cards on the contrary require that you explicitly specify the sample rate, so beware of this situation.</LI></UL><P>to control the main volume, you can use the gain slider in the <A HREF="ControlRoomFrame.html">control room window</A>(accessible from the window-menu). this is useful for very silent sounds or for floating point files which go wayabove 0 dBFS, in which case you can turn down the volume, until playback is undistorted. you might also want to usethe limiter in the control room window for sound files that go above 0 dBFS.</P></body></html>
