<h1><IMG SRC="iconBlendTool.png" ALT="">&nbsp;Blending Mode</h1>
<p>
When the blending mode is activated (by clicking on the blending gadget or using keyboard <tt>B</tt> &ndash; the gadget turns yellow), most editing operations are carried out in a smooth way, by applying a user definable crossfade at the margins of the processed selection. <STRONG>Example:</STRONG> in a ten second sound file, you select the portion from 0:04 till 0:06 and hit <tt>Delete</tt> to remove it. You may end up with a click sound at the cutting point because of the sudden jump in the waveform that may occur. An effective means to get rid of these clicks is to make a softer cut. To do this, activate blending. Assume, you have selected a blending duration of 20 milliseconds. Now the before mentioned cutting operation will be carried out, such that a sound bit 0:05.990 till 0:06.000 (re original timeline) will be faded in at 0:04 (re target timeline) and a sound bit 0:04.000 till 0:04.010 (re original timeline) will be faded out at 0:04 (re target timeline), while still exactly the portion from 0:04 till 0:06 is cutted out. This means, you get a 20 millisecond crossfade at the cutting position.
</p><p>
Blending is applied for cut, delete, paste, insert-silence and all operations from the process menu. Blending is not applied in trim-to-selection.

<h2>Customizing Blending</h2>
<P>
The blending controls can be brought up in a separate window by doing a mouse <tt>Alt</tt>+<tt>Click</tt> over the blending gadget. Alternatively you can keep the mouse pressed over the gadget, and a context window will pop up. In this window, you can specify the blending (crossfade) time in milliseconds or samples and adjust the blending curve using two control points. Hint: if both control points are vertically centered, a linear crossfade is performed; if one control point is vertically centered and the other control point is at the top margin, an equal power crossfade is performed (with a crossing point of -3 dB). The equal power curve is often less audible when the crossfaded signal is not phase-correlated.
</P><P>
Note that the blending span gets automatically truncated, if the possible crossfade span is too small.  Also note that blending may be undesired for many processes, notably when using fade-in and fade-out. The signal processing is not aware of this fact, so you may need to turn off blending temporarily in these cases.

<P>Here is a screenshot of the blending window:</P>

<P>If you open the blending window in popup mode (keeping the mouse pressed over the combo box), you can terminate the window explictly by clicking on the &quot;Close&quot; button. In this case, the settings are stored in the blending history which can be accessed from the choice-button right to the blending gadget. Here you will find the five most recent settings:</P>
