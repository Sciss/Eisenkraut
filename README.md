## downloading

A binary version of Eisenkraut for all platforms is provided through
[archive.org](https://archive.org/details/eisenkraut) and
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Sciss/Eisenkraut/releases/latest).
You need a Java runtime for Eisenkraut. Type `java -version` in a terminal to find out whether you have Java installed.
Otherwise, look at https://adoptopenjdk.net/ for ways of installing OpenJDK on your operating system. Furthermore, you
need SuperCollider, the installation of which is described in the next section.

## setting up and running

### installing SuperCollider

Eisenkraut uses the [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) server as the audio playback engine. You need
to install a recent SuperCollider 3 version to run this software. The recommended version of SuperCollider is 3.10.x
but things back to 3.7.x should work fine.

### starting eisenkraut

To launch Eisenkraut, you use the `eisenkraut` shell script (Linux and OS X) or the `eisenkraut.bat` script (Windows).
When using the Debian package, you have `eisenkraut` on your path and can find a desktop entry to add to your
favourites.

After launching Eisenkraut for the first time, make sure the "SuperCollider Server (scsynth)" field in the audio
preferences is pointing to the valid `scsynth` or `scsynth.exe` (on Windows) file!
__On OS X, newer SuperCollider versions "hide" the `scsynth` command line tool inside the `SuperCollider.app` bundle.__
Thus the correct path will
be something like `/Applications/SuperCollider/SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources/scsynth`.

Also note that, by default, the audio server is not automatically booted, so you need to press the "Boot" button in
the main window to launch the server and be able to actually _hear_ the sound file when playing it back. There is a
preferences switch to enable automatic booting.

## building from source

Eisenkraut can be build from source with [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/#install).

 - to compile: `sbt compile`
 - to package: `sbt package`
 - to run: `sbt run`
 - to make a standalone jar: `sbt assembly`
 
The release bundles are produced with tasks `universal:packageBin` and `debian:packageBin`.

__Note:__ Somebody decided to change the API of `javax.swing.tree.TreeNode` in a non-backwards compatible
fashion. The project currently requires JDK 8 to compile, as JDK 11 contains this
breakage. We may decide in the future to move on to JDK 11 or 12.

## to-do's

A lot. Here are some suggestions:

 - Still need to integrate FScape (more a job about FScape than about Eisenkraut)
 - Finding a way to edit with simultaneous video display (might be a separate app synchronized through some kind of
   OSC transport)
 - Optionally saving meta-information with the sound files (e.g. a separate XML file), like panorama settings, window
   bounds etc.
 - Finishing sonogram functionality (needs decimation and must be editable)
 - Improving SuperCollider interface and classes
 - etc. etc.

In the long-term, Eisenkraut will most likely be integrated with Mellite.
