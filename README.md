## Eisenkraut### statementEisenkraut is a standalone, cross-platform audio file editor using the SuperCollider 3 server application.Eisenkraut is (C)opyright 2004&ndash;2012 by Hanns Holger Rutz.

Source git repository is at [GitHub](https://github.com/Sciss/Eisenkraut).### buildingEisenkraut can be build from source with the [simple-build-tool](http://www.scala-sbt.org/#install) (sbt) version 0.12. It requires Java 1.6, and library dependencies are currently included as jars in the `lib` folder.If you do not have or wish to install sbt on your system, a shortcut is to use the provided Unix (OS X and Linux) script `sbt` which comes in the main folder. It may be invoked as `./sbt` and will automatically download the correct `sbt-launch.jar` version and place it in the main Eisenkraut directory, the first time it is executed. To build on __OS X__:    $ sbt appbundleThe result will be `Eisenkraut.app` in the main directory.To build on __Linux__ or __Windows__:    $ sbt assemblyThe result will be `target/Eisenkraut-assembly-<version>.jar`. This should be double-clickable, and otherwise can be launched with `java -jar target/Eisenkraut-...jar`.### setting up and runningEisenkraut uses the [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/) server as the audio playback engine. You need to install a recent SuperCollider 3 version to run this software. The recommended version is SuperCollider 3.5 or newer. After launching Eisenkraut for the first time, make sure that the "SuperCollider Server (scsynth)" field in the audio preferences is pointing to the valid `scsynth` or `scsynth.exe` (on Windows) file! __On OS X, newer SuperCollider versions "hide" the `scsynth` command line tool inside the `SuperCollider.app` bundle.__ So the correct path will be something like `/Applications/SuperCollider/SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources/scsynth`.Also note that, by default, the audio server is not automatically booted, so you need to press the "Boot" button in the main window to launch the server and be able to actually _hear_ the soundfile when playing it back. There is a preferences switch to enable automatic booting.### documentationPlease refer to the `help/index.html` file for a list of manual topics.### to-do'sA lot. Here are some suggestions: - Still need to integrate FScape (more a job about FScape than about Eisenkraut) - Finding a way to edit with simultaneous video display (might be a separate app synchronized through some kind of OSC transport) - Optionally saving meta-information with the soundfiles (e.g. a separate XML file), like panorama settings, window bounds etc. - Finishing sonagramme functionality (needs decimation and must be editable) - Improving SuperCollider interface and classes - etc. etc.
