Please consider supporting this project through Liberapay (see badge above) â€“ thank you!

## downloading

A binary version of Eisenkraut for all platforms is provided through
[archive.org](https://archive.org/details/eisenkraut) and
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Sciss/Eisenkraut/releases/latest).
You need a Java runtime for Eisenkraut. Type `java -version` in a terminal to find out whether you have Java installed.
Otherwise, look at [adoptopenjdk.net](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) for ways of installing OpenJDK on your operating system.
Furthermore, you need SuperCollider, the installation of which is described in the next section.

## setting up and running

### installing SuperCollider

Eisenkraut uses the [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) server as the audio playback engine. You need
to install a recent SuperCollider 3 version to run this software. The recommended version of SuperCollider is 3.10.x
but things back to 3.7.x should work fine.

### starting eisenkraut

To launch Eisenkraut, you use the `eisenkraut` shell script (Linux and OS X) or the `eisenkraut.bat` script (Windows).
When using the Debian package, you have `eisenkraut` on your path and can find a desktop entry to add to your
favourites.

After launching Eisenkraut for the first time, make sure the "SuperCollider Server (scsynth)" field in the audio
preferences is pointing to the valid `scsynth` or `scsynth.exe` (on Windows) file!
__On OS X, newer SuperCollider versions "hide" the `scsynth` command line tool inside the `SuperCollider.app` bundle.__
Thus the correct path will
be something like `/Applications/SuperCollider/SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources/scsynth`.

Also note that, by default, the audio server is not automatically booted, so you need to press the "Boot" button in
the main window to launch the server and be able to actually _hear_ the sound file when playing it back. There is a
preferences switch to enable automatic booting.

On Linux, you can prevent that multiple instances of Eisenkraut are opened (for example, when you double click on 
sound files in the desktop file manager), by enabling the OSC server (Preferences > OSC). A running OSC server will be
detected, and instead the currently running instance will be used to open another file.

When using a newer JDK, you will see the following warning messages upon start:

    WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
    WARNING: Illegal reflective access by com.thoughtworks.xstream.core.util.Fields ...
    WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of com.thoughtworks.xstream.core.util.Fields
    WARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal reflective access operations
    WARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release

This is harmless and can be ignored. It is caused by the look-and-feel. Future versions may try to fix this warning.

## building from source

Eisenkraut can be build from source with [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/#install).

 - to compile: `sbt compile`
 - to package: `sbt package`
 - to run: `sbt run`
 - to make a standalone jar: `sbt assembly`
 
The release bundles are produced with tasks `universal:packageBin` and `debian:packageBin`.

__Note:__ Somebody decided to change the API of `javax.swing.tree.TreeNode` in a non-backwards compatible
fashion. The project currently requires JDK 8 to compile, as JDK 11 contains this
breakage. We may decide in the future to move on to JDK 11 or 12.

## to-do's

The following items are left on my to-do list, but in the long-term, Eisenkraut will be integrated with Mellite.

 - Still need to integrate FScape (more a job about FScape than about Eisenkraut)
 - Finding a way to edit with simultaneous video display (might be a separate app synchronized through some kind of
   OSC transport)
 - Optionally saving meta-information with the sound files (e.g. a separate XML file), like panorama settings, window
   bounds etc.
 - Finishing sonogram functionality (needs decimation and must be editable)
 - Improving SuperCollider interface and classes
 - etc. etc.
