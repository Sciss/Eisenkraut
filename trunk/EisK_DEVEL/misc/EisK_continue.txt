in AudioTrail
	Method analogous to the paste method, but with audio not being copied (except for the blend span)

Control room : Master Levels optionally Post/ Pre switchable

Pencil tool

Pins-Icon instead of "smps" (UnitLabel)

Insert Silence : should not ignore blending

View : document local ( use setReadPrefs( false ) on window specific action copies )
	   same for catch + blend + loop

DocumentFrame default size (esp. ignore collapsed!)

Autom. Scrolling when making timeline selection beyond window bounds

keyboard short cut for increasing/decreasing master volume

solo + mute buttons without pressed state (instantaneously on/off)

CAREFULLY CHECK DEFAULT PREFS AFTER PREFS ARE DELETED
(i.e. SuperCollider OSC port might not be 0 etc.)

Idea : addtional views, e.g. another view (with catch) in higher zoom level

Visual Guides for Blendtime!!

Snap to ...

Channel Meters : display peak in cursor tab of the observer!


Alternative Panner :  - none (write diretly on a channel = saves busses !)
				- binaural
				- amisonics
				- panaz (as used currently)

or : bus per sound file selectable ! i.e. mixer window

overlay display (one chan row header for all channels, horiz. chain of meters, one single waveform display using multichannel overlay)

- auto disable MenuGroup when all elements are disabled

- doc frames : each new should be shifted to the bottom right
