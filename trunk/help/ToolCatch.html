<p>
When catch mode is active (keyboard <tt>V</tt>), the timeline view will automatically advance, just before the timeline position moves outside the window in playback (what is called 'Page Scroll during Playback' in ProTools for example) or timeline-drag. Dragging the <A HREF="TimelineScroll.html">timeline scroll bar</A> disables catch if the drag is released and the timeline position is outside the view. When catch &quot;looses track&quot; of the timeline position, simply re-active it by pressing <code>V</code> twice.
