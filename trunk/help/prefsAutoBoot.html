<h1>Audio Prefs : Automatic SC Boot Upon Startup</h1>
<p>
few people want to edit their soundfiles without listening to them, so usually you will want supercollider to be started automatically, when eisenkraut is opened. if this preferences field is checked, scsynth is booted automatically. otherwise, you will have to press the &quot;Boot&quot; button of the main window manually.
