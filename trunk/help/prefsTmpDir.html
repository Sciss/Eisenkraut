<h1>General Prefs : Temporary Folder</h1>
<p>
The application creates a couple of temporary files which will be deleted automatically when
a session is closed or the program is quit. On Un*x systems, they should go to <code>&quot;/var/tmp&quot;</code>,
but you may want to choose a folder on a different harddisk if your system partition is small, for example.
</p>
<P>Eisenkraut currently has no means to determine the free space in the temporary folder, so be sure to point it to a harddisk partition that is big enough to hold all the edits you wish to perform. As a rule of thumb, a monophonic sound at 44.1 kHz takes around 20 MB per minute (since all edits are performed in 32bit floating point format).</P>
