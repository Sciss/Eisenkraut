<h1>Channel Meters</h1>
<p>
These meters show the pre-fader signal level for each source channel of a document. The meter's visibility depends on the View-&gt;Channel Metters setting. The meters only work when the SuperCollider server is running, and their range and ballistics are the same as those for the <A HREF="ControlRoomFrame.html">control room meters.</A>
