(diamond shaped icon from the toolbar). blending will apply crossfades to editing operations, for example to avoid clicks when cutting.</P><P>to save your file, press meta + s. to save under a new name, choose save-as from the file menu. a rather strange dialog will pop up showing the current path name and format. to browse the harddisk, click on the small list symbol right to the path name.</P><h3>sound playback</h3><P>to actually hear your sound when running the transport, supercollider needs to be running. you will want to set the preferences to automatically booting supercollider when eisenkraut is launched (<A HREF="prefsAudio.html">audio preferences</A>). for the first time, start supercollider manually: go to the <A HREF="MainFrame.html">main window</A>. press boot and wait, until the button's text changes to &quot;terminate&quot;. if you encounter an error, check the following things:</P><UL><LI>open eisenkraut's preferences, go to the audio tab. check that scsynth application really points to supercollider server (the file <code>scsynth<var>[</var>.exe<var>]</var></code> in your supercollider folder!).</LI><LI>note that the IP address is ignored, because scsynth is launched locally always. the port number needs usually not be changed, unless you have another supercollider application running at the same port.</LI><LI>if you get an error message saying that option -H is not understood, clear the audio device name preferences. in this case the system default audio hardware will be used.</LI><LI>note on mac, that the built in audio card doesn't support sample rates other than 44.1 kHz. set the hardware sample rate prefernces to 0 (zero) to use the valid default sample rate.</LI></UL><P>the gain slider in the server window can be used to control the master volume. this is useful for very silent sounds or for floating point files which go way above 0 dBFS, in which case you can turn down the volume, until playback is undistorted.</P></body></html>
