<h1>Channel Track Header</h1>
<p>
For each channel a separate waveform view is shown in the main frame. On the left side there is a header showing the name of the channel (the channel index) and a few gadgets: The &quot;S&quot; and &quot;M&quot; buttons turn on/off soloing and muting the channel. Solo is performed inplace, that is the channel is played through its regular channel.

The circle shaped icon indicates the panorama setting for that channel. At the moment these settings are not saved, so when you open a new sound file they are restored to defaults. If you click on the icon, a <A HREF="ChannelPanorama.html">channel panorama window</A> will open which allows you to change the azimuth and divergence of the channel's panorama.
