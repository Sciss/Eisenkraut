<h4>i can open a soundfile but i don't hear anything when playing back</h4>
<P>
here's a list of possible reasons and hints:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the SuperCollider server isn't running. at the bottom of the <A HREF="MainFrame.html">main window</A>, there should be printed a valid sampling rate at which the server runs, the button on the right should read &quot;terminate&quot; to indicate the server has been booted. Check the meters in the control room frame: if they don't move, the server communication isn't working.</LI>
<LI>assuming SuperCollider is running. check for error messages in the <A HREF="MainFrame.html">console</A>. <A HREF="todo.html">known issues</A> include pathnames with special characters and certain soundfile formats (e.g. IRCAM 24bit int doesn't play back). The error message &quot;Exception in World_OpenTCP: unable to bind tcp socket&quot; when booting SuperCollider indicates that a server was booted before but not properly quit. Check the known issues document for ways of killing the server in this case.</LI>
<LI>check the main volume and the main output configuration in the <A HREF="ControlRoomFrame.html">control room window</A>. Also check the audio device used. In the console window, look for the &quot;Output Device&quot; used by SuperCollider (the device name is printed when booting). On Mac OS X it's possible to accidentally boot a device without output channels (e.g. built-in microphone).</LI>
<LI>try to quit and relaunch eisenkraut. try to quit and relaunch the supercollider server. try to close and reopen your document. try to convert your document to a different soundfile format.</LI>
</UL>
<h4>my soundcard don't show up</h4>
<P>
currently, eisenkraut has no means of finding out automatically about the connected audio interfaces. instead you must create an &quot;audio box&quot; manually in the <A HREF="prefsAudioBoxes.html">audio box preferences</A>. supercollider will print out all available devices in the console when it's booted, so you may pick up the correct device name from the <A HREF="MainFrame.html">console</A>.
</P>
<!-- <h3>regarding version 0.7</h3> -->
<h4>what happened to <code>Process->Silence</code>?</h4>
<P>
the same functionality is available by choosing the <code>Overwrite</code> edit mode and <code>Edit->Clear</code>.
