When re-opening these sound files again, the waveform overview needn't be recalculated which speeds up the opening operation a lot. In the preferences dialog you can specify the folder in which the cache files are placed and the limiting size of the folder. if the capacity of the cache folder exceeds the given limit, the oldest cache is removed automatically. the default size of 100 MB holds approx. 75 ... 100 waveforms. The files are quite big (about a 1/20th of the original sound file size) but are high quality. In a future version there might be an option to store them in smaller sizes.</P><P>Files are identified by their name, modification date, number of channels and frames. Therefore, if any of these data changes, the cache for that file becomes useless and gets deleted the next time you open the modified file.</P><P>By default, cache is not active. In the preferences dialog there is a checkbox which needs to be selected for caching to become active. The default folder is <code>UserHomeDirectory/Eisenkraut/cache</code>. It's safe to remove cache files manually.</P></body></html>
