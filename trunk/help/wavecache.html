When re-opening these sound files again, the waveform overview needn't be recalculated which speeds up the opening operation a lot. In the preferences dialog you can specify the folder in which the cache files are placed and the limiting size of the folder. if the capacity of the cache folder exceeds the given limit, the oldest cache is removed automatically. the default size of 100 MB holds approx. 75 ... 100 waveforms. The files are quite big (about a 1/20th of the original sound file size) but are high quality. In a future version there might be an option to store them in smaller sizes.</P><P>Files are identified by their name, modification date, number of channels and frames. Therefore, if any of these data changes, the cache for that file becomes useless and gets deleted the next time you open the modified file.</P><h2>Preferences Settings</h2><UL><LI><B>Cache Waveform Overview</B> : this checkbox enables the cache manager. By default, cache is not active.</LI><LI><B>Cache Capacity</B> : sets the maximum size in megabytes, to which the cache folder can grow. if the folder sizes becomes bigger, the oldest cache files are removed.</LI><LI><B>Cache Folder</B> : sets the folder in which the cache files are stored. note that unlike other programmes, eisenkraut doesn't save the cache files in the same place as the soundfiles themselves, so you don't end up with your harddisk cluttered with &quot;.ovr&quot; files or the like. you can at any time empty the cache folder. by default, the folder <code>Eisenkraut/cache</code> inside your home folder is used. files are named using a hash code and therefore their names are not human readable. It's safe to remove cache files manually.</LI></UL></body></html>
