<h1>Audio Prefs : Audio Block Size</h1>
<p>
this is a parameter used when booting supercollider (<code>-z</code>). it specifies the number of audio samples calculated in each computation cycle. the default value is 64. lower values give lower latency at the expense of higher CPU load.
</P><P>
when using control rate signals, the audio block size specifies the rate at which control signals are calculated: one control sample is calculated for each audio block, hence for audio block size 64 and server running at 44.1 kHz, the control rate is 44100/64 = approx. 689 Hertz. decreasing the audio block size increases the control rate.
