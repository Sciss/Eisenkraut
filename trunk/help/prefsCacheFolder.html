<h1>General Prefs : Cache Folder</h1>
<p>
sets the folder in which <A HREF="wavecache.html">waveform caching</a> files are stored. note that unlike other programmes, eisenkraut doesn't save the cache files in the same place as the soundfiles themselves, so you don't end up with your harddisk cluttered with &quot;.ovr&quot; files or the like. you can at any time empty the cache folder.
</P><P>
by default, the folder <code>Eisenkraut/cache</code> inside your home folder is used. files are named using a hash code and therefore their names are not human readable.
