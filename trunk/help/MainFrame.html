<h1>Main Window</h1>

On the top you see a horizontal slider that controls the main (monitoring) volume. Note that at the moment there is no built-in limiter that prevents audio from distortion if you raise the volume such that samples exceed 0 dBFS. This will be available in a future version.
</P><p>
The main part of the window is a console view showing messages both from SuperCollider and runtime errors and messages from Eisenkraut.
</P><p>
The button &quot;Dump OSC&quot; is for debugging purposes. However, the list next to it is of importance. It contains all available output routings. An output routing describes how many logical channels are created for playback and how they are mapped to the physical channels of your sound card. To create your own setups, choose <A HREF="IOSetup.html">&quot;I/O Setup&quot;</A> from the window menu. The actual distribution of your sound file's channels onto the output channels is controlled by the channel panorama, accessed from the <A HREF="ChannelTrack.html">channel's track header</A>.

the bottom line of the window displays the supercollider status : the sample rate at which it runs, the current average CPU usage and the number of synthesis objects.
