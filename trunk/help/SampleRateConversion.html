<h1>Sample Rate Conversion</h1>
<p>
this label will light up red when the sound file's sample rate differs from the audio hardware rate at which supercollider runs. this indicates that sample rate conversion is used to play back the sound file at the correct speed and pitch. if both rates are equal, for example if you play back a 44.1 kHz sound file and your sound card also runs at 44.1 kHz, the label will stay gray.
</P><P>
you can alter the hardware sample rate in the <A HREF="prefsAudioRate.html">audio preferences</A>. you can alter the header information of the sound file by clicking on the <A HREF="AudioHeaderInfo.html">(i)-icon</A> in the bottom left corner of the waveform window.
