<h1>Rotate Channels</h1>
<p>
Shifts channels, for example such that the former left channel becomes the right channel and vice versa.
</P><P>
The shift value naturally can be between <code>-(NumberOfChannels-1)</code> ... <code>+(NumberOfChannels-1)</code>. For mono it's useless, for stereo the only usefull value is 1 which swaps left and right channel. For an eight channel sound file, choosing a value of 1 will put channel 1 in channel 2, channel 2 is put in channel 3 etc. For a value of 6, channel 1 is put in channel 7, channel 2 is put in channel 8, channel 3 is put in channel 1 (3 + 6 = 9, wraps to 1). etc.
